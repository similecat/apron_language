The project is used as an independent permission language executor.

To execute a permission checking, you need:
	1. create the evaluator with permission descriptions.
	2. create a Access Control Request, and assign this to evaluator.
	3. run the evaluator.

Sample code as followed:
	eval = CreateEvaluator();
	eval.permReq = req;
	return eval.execute();
	
To make the evaluator run correctly, you need to write extra code within your controller:
	1. Methods to transfer API call and its parameters to unified ACL request.
	2. A wrapper TopologyManager to implement the interface of ITopologyManager.
