The project is used as an independent permission language executor.

To execute a permission checking, you need:
	1. create the evaluator with permission descriptions.
	2. create a Access Control Request, and assign this to evaluator.
	3. run the evaluator.

Sample code as followed:
	eval = CreateEvaluator();
	eval.permReq = req;
	return eval.execute();
	
To make the evaluator run correctly, you need to write extra code within your controller:
	1. Methods to transfer API call and its parameters to unified ACL request.
	2. A wrapper TopologyManager to implement the interface of ITopologyManager.
	
1) ACL request.
ACL need to check following permissions. So any request's related value should be set.

(1) For example, if APP is trying to use flow_mod to add a new flow. 
	Set the "type" as OFType.FLOW_MOD. (optional)
	"switchID" should be set. (required)
	the "match" part should be set, including ip, port, input e.g. 
	set the action list "actions". "actions" consists of a list of "OFAction". set them according to detailed flow mod.
	set the priority of the flow.


Example(2), if APP is trying to send PACKET_OUT.
	Set the "type" as OFType.FLOW_MOD. (required)
	"switchID" should be set. (required)
	the "match" part should be set, including ip, port, input e.g. (required)
	
Example(3), if APP is trying to access to the response(event) from switch.
	Set the notification level the APP wanted(just INTERCEPTION or want to modify the event: maybe modify the event, drop the event, prevent the event processed by others).
	
Example(4), if APP want to access statistics.
	Set the statistics level according the parameters.
